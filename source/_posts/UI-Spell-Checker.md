Have you ever thought about spell checking system continues to interrupt typing flow? Sometimes I just want to correct all my spelling mistakes at one time after my paragraph comes to an end. However the spell checker will pop out to show some spelling suggestions or just replace my mistakes automatically while I am still typing.

### // Can spell checking experience be improved? //

## THE INSPIRATION WAS TOOK FROM COIN PUSHER

Spelling mistakes in article will be remarked as a solid(3D) materials. When one tap on the trigger for spell check. It will act like a coin pusher to push spelling mistakes to another layer. So one has an independent and clean layer for spell checking.

After finish the spell checking, one can tap on the trigger again to push the corrections back to original layer.
