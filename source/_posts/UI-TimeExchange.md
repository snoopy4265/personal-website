**Inspiration:**
I along with some friends was really fond of language exchange. However, we found that traditional language exchange or skill exchange were restricted in the one-on-one frame.In other words, exchange only happened when both people happened to bear the skill the other person wanted. Thus, I and four like-minded friends who also encountered similar problems decided to sort out a way to solve the problem. I was the designer in the team.

**Ideate:**
After brainstorming with my friends, we agreed to establish a platform, using the concept of Time Bank to manage exchanging. Broadly speaking, no matter language or skill exchange was a kind of time exchange. We hope to import the idea of money expenditure and deposit into time spent. For example, contributing one hour of drawing could gain one hour credit to exchange skills other people offer.

**Core Value:**
Before we started the design of our branding system, we spent a lot of time to define our core value and what story we were going to tell. We combined our main idea: “Time” and “Exchange” and called this project “TIMEXCHANGE”. Meanwhile, we were also searching for a theme or an image that could represent the idea. We choose galaxy as our key visual, to demonstrate our ideology of believing everyone is a shining star in galaxy.

Our website is a platform where allows everyone not only see their own lights (found out their own value of teaching others), but also get in touch with other stars in galaxy (exchange skills with others). And eventually light up the galaxy together (to make the whole world better).

> We believe everyone has at least one or two skills that worth sharing to the world.

When coming up with the idea of learning or exchanging skills, people might be tempted to think of boring or serious. However, we want to twist this stereotype, give our website a joyful and playful atmosphere.

**Typography:**
Therefore as typography I choose round typeface. It is because round typeface has affinity and wasn’t too serious. I choose to use “Varela Round” as English typeface, for it being an open-source sans-serif typeface that is available for free through Google Fonts. This means we can easily apply it on our website. For the Chinese version, I choose”王漢宗細圓體”, in order to stay in similar tone with English font.

**Color:**
To meet the concept of galaxy, I choose dark purple as the main color, which also has the color scheme of a video game. Turquoise color and Honeysuckle color are chosen as accent color. These two accent colors make people feel delightful and playful. Furthermore, their vibrant color tone works well with flat design style.

**Logo Structure:**
The logo is a combination of the letter “E” and “X”, forming the shape of sandglass, which represents our core value—time. The reason is because broadly speaking, skill exchange is a kind of time exchange. The “change” happens through the exchange of time, and creates new value.

**Result:**
We are now still working on this exciting project. So far from now we have completed our design, identity system and guideline. Our next step is to build the website. With previous effort of thinking and discussing our design system, will definitely be the strength of our website in the future.
