This is a side project I did with my friend. We both are learning German but suffer from memorising new vocabulary. Especially when reading German articles, we always need to look up new words in dictionary and try to write them down else where to memorise. Therefore, we start to think if the experience of learning new words from articles can be improved?

As a result, we developed this simple web application to let people memorise German words easier. The design idea was appropriated from my previous project "Spellcheck Pusher". To use this, one just need to simply import an English or German article, collect unknown words, and then start to learn. The process is streamlined and intuitive.

I was mainly in charge of the design part while my friend was responsible for the development. The application was built on Node.js, React.js and applied Mateiral-UI.
