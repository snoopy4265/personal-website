Heineken PG is the abbreviation for “Heineken Promotion Girl.” This was an outsourced case from Heineken Taiwan, requesting to develop an APP for PGs to report their time of clocking in and out, sales, and problems they encountered. All the information would be kept in a database for supervisor to examine and oversee the performance of PGs. I was mainly in charge of the UI design during the APP development.

Due to Heineken itself is a substantial global corporation, it has actually already got quite complete CI Guideline. Thus, inside this case, I mostly adhered to the guideline; resulting in fewer innovative designs appeared. Still, many details of the UI and user experience during the design process were worth discussing.

### Conflict
In fact this was the first formal APP design case I was involved in. Thus, at first I was so enthusiastic that I attempted to make the interface marvelous. In the mockup draft, hoping to demonstrate ingenuity, I applied the trending style of flat design, and even tried to draw the clock-in page as real clock cards.

However, I actually bumped against the wall. The idea of flat design doesn’t really suit Heineken’s taste. To Heineken, the idea was too immature, failing to match the brand image of Heineken. In addition, drawing the clock-in page as the real clock card violated the primitive UI typesetting, generating difficulty for implementation. Also, it wasn’t a common interface for users, which made it confusing for them.

### Design Version 1

### Core Value
After bumping against the wall, I decided to return to the core value of design: “human-centered.” Considering from the perspective of PG, this APP should be convenient and simple for their use. PGs would only use the APP to quickly report their work, instead of remaining too long on the APP. Moreover, the turnover rate of PG is high, so there would always be new PGs needing to learn the APP.

### Redesign
After pondering, I redefined the design objective.
The first priority was to provide a clear and concise interface, enabling PGs to quickly report. Further, the interface should be user-friendly, reducing the time needed for new PGs to pick up the APP.

### Result
The APP finally got Heineken’s recognition. The design met their brand image; the End User test also responded positive feedbacks. Many PGs commented that the APP was easy to use, especially the clear-cut interface. Currently, the APP is only for internal use, not published on app store. Heineken Promotion Girls in Taiwan still use the APP for work report until now.
