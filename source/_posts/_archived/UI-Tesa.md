<p style="color:#aaa;">Client: TeSA | Year: 2015</p>

TeSA is the abbreviation for Taiwan E-commerce & Startup Association. In 2015, I designed the official website for TeSA: http://www.tesa.today. On the website, it mainly provided articles related to online startup, E-commerce, and digital marketing, enabling people interested in these fields to obtain information.

Since the website was content-based, the first priority of designing it was to provide easy and comfortable reading experience. Thus, I set the font-size of PC browsing at 20px, line-height at 1.9, and extra space between paragraphs, which was the most pleasant typesetting for users.

Also, for mobile browsing, I adopted Responsive Design, creating the best experience for small-screen browsing. Currently the website has up to 50,000 daily pageviews, which is within the top 1000 websites in Taiwan on Alexa.
