<p style="color:#aaa;">Springlane Intern | Year: 2014</p>

During my exchange term in Germany, besides studying in RWTH Aachen, I also applied actively for internship in order to accumulate my practical experience in design. Luckily, I got hired as a graphic design intern in an E-commerce shop company mainly selling kitchenware called SPRINGLANE: http://www.springlane.de. The internship has lasted for 3 months. Following are my works accomplished during the time in SPRINGLANE.

### Inforgraphic
Except for E-commerceshop, SPRINGLANE also own an online magazine for posting articles such as infographic, receipt and other cooking relevant topics. As an intern, my very first independent accomplish work (from planning to wireframe to design) was doing infographic. I used my information architecture and UX knowledge learned from college to manage data and make easily understandable compose type. Then finally design it to graphic format.
