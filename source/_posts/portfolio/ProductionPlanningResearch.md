### Background
At Infarm, one of the main user groups our team serves is <mark>capacity planners, whose job is to leverage farm capacity in order to achieve maximum production with minimum resources.</mark> However, as a new product designer on board, I realized that I didn't know enough about capacity planners and the overall production planning process. Gaps in user knowledge prevented me from creating the right digital tools to meet user needs. Therefore, after discussions with the product manager, we decided to allocate time to conduct user research to close our user knowledge gaps and gather insights to guide future development.

</br>

### Goal & Focus
- Close gaps of Capacity planners journey, pain points and opportunities
- Understand how Capacity planners are using their tools
- Generate insights to feed potential next Q or H initiatives

### Planning & Prepping
At the beginning, we spent around 2 days aligning on the goal, scope and deliverables. <mark>Defining what do we want to learn and which exercises can most likely achieve our goal. Discussing who do we need to include and if there's any past material/research that would help on this research.</mark> We then set up according sessions for the upcoming weeks and distribute tasks and responsibilities.

### Filling Knowledge Gaps
<strong>User Interviews:</strong>
We conducted 3 in-depth interviews with users to understand how they were currently planning for capacity. The interviews were driven and facilitaed by me. I gave the users realistic tasks to work on and asked them to think out loud during the process. Because they are experts in the field of production planning, we were able to map out the detailed user journey through the interviews with them, including the tools they use, the people they regularly contact, and the things they care about in order to get their job done. <mark>This not only helped us fill in the gaps in our knowledge about production planning, but also gave us many valuable insights.</mark>

<strong>Journey Mapping:</strong>
Based on the user interviews, I then mapped out an end to end production planning journey. Actually, there were user journey map done by past researches but it was either incomplete or outdated. <mark>One of our major achievements in this study was the completion of the user journey, which covered almost all aspects of the capacity planner's work. This is a great leap forward from our previous user journey map.</mark>

### Understanding Future Projections and Relationships Between Other User Groups 
<strong>Stakeholder Interviews:</strong>
Besides user interviews, we also conducted 3 stakeholder interviews to understand their interaction with the capacity planners. And most importantly, to understand their expectations around our digital tools on supporting the whole production planning process. The stakeholder interviews were driven from the product side and I was mainly helping on taking notes and synthesising insights.

### Sharing & Presentation

At the end, I created a research report documenting all the things we learned and insights we collected along the research. <mark>I shared this report with the whole software team and did a presentation in one of the software team sprint review sessions. The feedback was really positive.</mark>

Several next steps were supposed to happen after this research in order to define opportunities and make insights actionable. Wider decisions around how the insights translate to initiatives and feed into next quarter are still open for discussion. However, there was at that time another pressing initiative that required support from our team, so the planned following steps of this study were postponed.<mark>Nevertheless, the outcome of this research along with insights collected are still remarkable and could already be a solid foundation for driving future discussion.</mark>
