<h3 class="mb-0 text-center font-weight-bold">Increase flexibility for production planning</h3>
<p class="text-muted text-center">Support Mixed Growing Cycles | Year: 2022</p>

</br>
</br>

### Problem Statement
Today, as a capacity planner planning the production of a farm, they are unable to allocate plants with different growing cycles in one single farm, which limits the flexibility of capacity planners to utilize space and reduce waste. Especially for those with high mix of plants and low yields, the profitability of the business is also affected due to inefficient use of space.

</br>

### Goal & Value Hypothesis
> How might we support capacity planners to plan flexible when it comes to mixing growing cycles in one farm?

<strong><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Business Value</strong>
- Increased product variety offers
- Maximise utilisation for Acre to reduce Opex and increase profitability

<strong><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> User Value</strong>
- Maximise flexibility of spreading different crops throughout different farms

</br>

### LEAN Product Development Process
Being aware of the timeline for this feature to be available, I'm trying to be agile in supporting mixed growing cycles by following much on LEAN UX method that can minimise risks of over-engineering features and help us move faster on iterations.

  <div class="col-12 col-md-9">
    I started from collecting past researches which I think might be helpful for this project and drafted out preliminary user journey based on existing knowledge base.

  </div>
  <div class="col-12 col-md-9">
    Then I sketches out 3 design concepts and listed out individual pros and cons of each concept. The idea was to create some visual references to drive the discussion and to quickly trash out if none of the concepts can fit.

  <div class="col-12 col-md-9">
    The reasons why I conducted a workshop first with the development team were because that, this initiative had a proposed software solution even prior to user research. Therefore, it's important to validate the design concepts to be feasible with the current software proposal in order to cope with the short timeline.

After the first round of the think-make-check cycle, I managed to gather a lot of feedback from the development team. Those inputs were synthesized through affinity mapping and categorized into different topics that helped me adjust my initial hypotheses.

    The preliminary user journey were updated and filled in with more detail.

  </div>
  <div class="col-12 col-md-9">
    With more knowledge and insights learned, I was able to narrow down from 3 design concepts and create 2 wireframes with detailed components and user flow.

    Then I conducted concept validation sessions with the users to collect feedback and understand what works for them, what doesn't. The main purpose was to quickly check in with users to help weigh in on a viable design concept.

### Design solution & Deliverables
Taken from what learned in the previous 2 round of iterations, I was able to document the comprehensive user journey and highlight on their need in each step. Therefore, I move on to finalise the design solution.

**User Journey Map:**
Refined again on the user journey and document users' needs, software touchpoints and potential hazards into one document.
