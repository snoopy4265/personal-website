### Rebranding & Rolling out MVP
Early 2020, MeinWunschcatering GmbH rebranded as **MYMY Catering**. In our rebranding design thinking workshop, we defined our brand vision and brand identity.

Based on the brand definition, I created brand visual identity and several design system deliverables, such as style guide and component library.

At the meantime, I was designing the user interfaces of our new website. The leadership decided internally that the whole website was going to build on **[Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/)** in order to best serve the need of the company. Thus, this decision led my design to CMS-driven components focused design.

<h3 class="mb-0">User Experience Analysis</h3>
Our MVP rolled out on July 4th. After the first version of the website was built, the whole company would like to better understand how users engage with the website, navigate and how intuitive it is. We, the product team, was then assigned to run an user experience analysis. 
<mark>**The goal is expected to deliver recommendations for improving our digital product, food product and content.**</mark>

### Identify Our Best Users
<h4 class="mb-0 text-center font-weight-bold"><mark>German Desktop Users From Organic Search</mark></h4>
We've used **Hotjar** to collect 100 video footages about users using MYMY Catering website. Due to limited time and resources, I only want to focus on videos that are from our best users to make sure our improvement can maximise its effectiveness. So called **best users** means users that are numerous and generate the most profit to the site. 

By looking at the data in **Google Analytic**, I can identify our best users are mostly from **Germany** coming from **organic Search**. I also found that although mobile brought the most traffic, **desktop users** turned out generated the most profit. The reason behind might be users nowadays mainly use mobile on browsing, while they still tend to use desktop to make sensitive decisions or placing orders.

<p class="text-muted text-center">According to Google Analytic, I summarized our best users are German Desktop Users From Organic Search</p>

</br>
</br>

### Define Our Challenges
Based on the best users criteria, 100 video footages are filtered down to 9 and been observed closely.

I sorted common user painpoints amongst the observation and found couple insights that we could focuse on.

    Most of the users landed on our website began with browsing purpose. However, the availability check on the homepage keep many users from entering the funnel. Users also do not clearly see our USPs on the homepage, nor do they scroll down and discover other useful content.<mark style="color: black;">
      <strong>Challenge:</strong>
      **How might we 'sell' MYMY catering more on the homepage above the fold and encourage the customer to explore more of the website?**

  <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
    Because catering order prices are usually huge, users tend to be more careful on placing orders. They spent time double checking order items and comparing the best option but the current website cannot provide enough information for them to decide if the product meets their qualifications.<mark style="color: black;">
      <strong>Challenge:</strong>
      **How might we give customers a better insight of what the food looks like, taste like and help them make decisions?**

### From Findings to Features
With all my research and insights in mind, I started scribbling some sketches on paper. For homepage, I did several changes to smoothen browsing experiences:

</br>

Inside our funnel, I added several informative feautres to users. We also collaborated with marketing team to provide more detailed product description on each item.

### Final Design and Takeaways

We implemented most of the short term solutions based on our findings from user research. There are as well as some long term action items which were already recorded down as Jira tickets and will be addressed in the near future. In the end, the leadership were very pleased with the recommendations we suggested and found them really helpful and are great initiatives.
