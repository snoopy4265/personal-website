<p class="text-muted text-center">Redesign Sauce Labs App Management | Year: 2023</p>

</br>

### Problems
There are several reasons for the redesign of app management. The primary reason is driven by customer feedback. We heard from customers that they were having **difficulties organising and managing their app builds** mainly because of our limited app management structure. With current app management, all the app builds that customers uploaded for testing are placed in one central location with only flat file structure. **<mark>This causes trouble for users managing apps for different environments and different testing purposes.</mark>**

</br>

Other reasons for the redesign include **considerations for future scalability** and **alignment with the long-term product vision** of creating a unified and user-friendly central app dashboard that integrates various functionalities from our product offerings. 
All in all, redesigning app management will serve as an important initial step in accommodating these developments.

</br>

### Goal & Focus
> Design a user-friendly and scalable app management system that aligns with the user's mental model, facilitating effortless organisation of their applications and quick retrieval for testing.

### Inspiration - Research & Synthesise

Research is king, especially as a newcomer to the workforce and touching on a new field, research becomes even more important. Fortunately, before I even started working here, many other product designers had designed, researched, and envisioned early concept of app management. There were also personas targeting different user groups of Sauce Labs as well as their journeys for me to look through. 

So I mainly started from collecting information from our existing knowlege base. Try to understand who are our users, what are their needs and pain points, what have currently been done so far and what do we envision.

    <strong>Inspiration</strong>
    <h3 class="text-left mb-0"><mark>User Persona</mark></h3>
    While we recognize that Sauce Labs serves many types of users, by cross-referencing Weekly Active User(WAU) of app management with user personas, it makes sense to focus primarily on these 2 personas:
    1. **Uploader/Maintainer**: Someone who is responsible to upload/maintain apps to Sauce Labs, mainly are mobile developers. 
    2. **Internal Tester**: Someone who is responsible for testing, could be QAs or developers.

    We also found out that users work in big corporations tend to report problems to us. Because they have a need of organising numerous apps and retrieve the right version to do quality check.

    After identifying the target users for the project, I worked with PM to map out the user journey. During this process, the PM, who has a background in app developing, explained to me the mobile development cycle and how our product intersects with various stages. This really helped me to understand the needs and pain points of users when interacting with our product.

### Desk Research & Competitor Analysis

After identifying the target customers for the project, I also conducted a round of desk research in an attempt to understand how app management is currently handled by us (Sauce Core and Test Fairy) and the competitors (Google's Firebase and Microsoft's App Center). Evaluate the strength and weakness of different ways of handling. Pinpoint the outlier and close the knowledge gap. 

This series of preliminary investigations gave us insights to initial questions such as:
- How do users organize their apps on these platforms?
- Why do users need to organize their apps?
- How many levels have users created to manage their apps?

After having a firm grasp of the current solutions out there, I needed to better understand the context and needs of users interacting with app management in order to move forward. Therefore, I worked with PM to map out the user journey.

### User Journey Mapping

After identifying the target users for the project, I worked with PM to map out the user journey. During this process, the PM, who has a background in app developing, explained to me the mobile development cycle and how our product intersects with various stages. This really helped me to understand the needs and pain points of users when interacting with our product.

### Data Model/Hierarchy Ideation

After user journey mapping, we shifted gears to focus our energies on all of the new possible data models for the new app management. We wanted to understand what the limitations and benefits of one data model would be over another. We projected what the interface would look like after introducing future features to ensure that our data model would scale to our product vision. I created 4 concept designs and after multiple rounds of iterations and discussion with PM, other designers and stakeholders, we landed on a final concept for a new information architecture.

</br>

### Concept Testing
To validate this concept, we conducted internal concept testing by interviewing 5 key customer-facing employees within our organization, such as technical account managers, customer support engineers, and solution engineers. As individuals who regularly interact with customers, they possess a deep understanding of user complaints and pain points. We presented them with the new concept design prototype and gathered their feedback.

Through this internal concept testing, we ensured that we are heading in the right direction and that people can understand the new hierarchy model we proposed, which is our original goal: introduce an app management system that aligns with the userâ€™s mental model. Our internal testers also suggested a number of improvements to the new design, which were carefully collated and prioritized for design modification.

### Hi-fi Design Prototype

After finalizing the design direction and information architecture, I proceeded to flesh out interfaces and user flows. At this stage, I designed more high fidelity prototypes, incorporating our company's design system while also utilizing data that closely resembles real-world scenarios. This included simulating actual app data, version numbers, and possible categorization methods within the interface. The itention was to facilitate easier comprehension and foster discussions among team members, enabling them to identify any potential logical gaps or flaws within the design.

### Task Analysis

At this stage of the design process, we aim to push the design to a subset of external users to gather insights on usability and to uncover any hidden issues in the workflow before handing over to the development. We decided to run a unmoderated clickable prototype testing by using [Maze](https://maze.co/) as a testing tool and [Pendo](https://go.pendo.io/demo-pendo-products-hv-z.html?cq_plac=&cq_net=g&cq_pos=&cq_med=&cq_plt=gp&cq_cmp=9965755808&gad=1) as a recruitment method. 

We asked users to go through a clickable prototype with 4 tasks and report if they believe they completed each task, how hard they would rate them, and their thoughts around the way. In the end, we were able to gather 21 responses + 6 responses from the internal pilot run, which gave us 27 data points to analyse. This fine-grained method of testing enabled us to pinpoint areas of the design that were successful and areas that needed further iteration. We then took those learnings and made even more improvements to the final design.

### Conclusion - Retrospective & Key Learnings

It is not easy to redesign a software service that already has many users. When users have already developed a habitual mental model for your product, it takes a lot of effort to introduce a new mental model and make it easy for users to learn without rebounding. It is also very important to collect feedback from users to verify our design.

I am grateful for the trust from the team to let me, a newbie, take on the responsibility of designing this project and give me timely help during the process. According to our product vision, we will add app distribution and error reporting functions to this project, and the benefits are expected to be very significant.
